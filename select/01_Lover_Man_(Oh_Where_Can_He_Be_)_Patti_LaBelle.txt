I don't know why but I'm feelin' so sad
I long to try something I've never had
Never had no kissin', ooh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me but no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can feel like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer that you'll make frantic love to me
Oh, strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears
A-huggin' and a-kissin', ooh, what we've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can feel like, heavenly, heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer that you'll make frantic love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweet little things in my ears
A-huggin' and a-kissin', ooh, what we've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

Lover man, oh, where can you be?
Lover man, lover man, oh, where are you?
