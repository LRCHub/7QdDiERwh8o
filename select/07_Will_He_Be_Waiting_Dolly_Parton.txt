I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears
He cried on my shoulder the day
That I told him goodbye

I never should have left him
Never should have gone
Oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me
He will be won't he
And will he take me back again

Shadows from the trees shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey's end

I wonder if he's missed me
Wonder if he wants me
I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Oh how I hope he will

He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry

Will he be waiting for me...
