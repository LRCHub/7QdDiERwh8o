[00:11.73] He takes me to the places you and I used to go
[00:24.16] He tells me over and over that he loves me so
[00:46.66] 
[00:36.52] He gives me love that I never got from you
[00:49.05] He loves me too, his love is true
[00:57.05] Why can't he be you?
[01:07.05] 
[01:04.68] He never fails to call and tell me I'm on his mind
[01:17.48] And I'm lucky to have such a guy, I hear it all the time
[01:45.48] 
[01:29.86] And he does all the things that you would never do
[01:42.37] He loves me too, his love is true
[01:50.36] Why can't he be you?
[02:00.36] 
[01:58.02] He's not the one who dominates my mind and soul
[02:10.51] And I should love him so, 'cause he loves me I know
[02:17.25] But his kisses leave me cold
[02:31.25] 
[02:26.34] He sends me flowers, calls on the hour, just to prove his love
[02:39.88] And my friends say when he's around, I'm all he speaks of
[03:08.38] 
[02:52.05] And he does all the things that you would never do
[03:04.79] He loves me too, his love is true
[03:13.22] Why can't he be you?
