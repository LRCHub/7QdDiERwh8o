His mood cycled faster than the weather in the mountains
The signs said we were in for snow

If i would have known I'd have stayed back home
This errand needs just one fool
If I would have known I would have stayed back home

Then every fiber shed it's softness in chain reaction
When he said "You're as bad as him" - "Jesus Christ I'm not that man."

The trait I want to show I've left back home
This errand needs just one fool
The trait I want to show I've left back home

"Weather the storm" he said
"Or you can wash your hands of the whole damn mess" Freefall
No matter our calls to mend, this bend won't be straightened
Had I known we would have stayed through all hollow guarantees?
And now the road back home is blocked with snow
Had I known?
See all the walls with the errant engravings
Tidings written so bold and plain
Too weak to see what we should know: weather can't be controlled

Drink this in whole - the abyss that will swallow us all one day
Just drink this in whole
"Weather the storm" She'd say
'Cause you can't wash your hands of this whole damn mess' Freefall
No matter what is said - it's ok
