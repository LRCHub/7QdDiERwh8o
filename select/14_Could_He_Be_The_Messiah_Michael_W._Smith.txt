Been here for days, I'm amazed at this teacher, carpenter, preacher
Lost in the crowd I hear him now he's praying and he's saying
"God feed them all"
Five thousand men, all of his friends are worried,
Find bread and hurry
Five loaves and fish, what can he wish, he's praying
Still he's saying "God feed them all"
Could he be the Messiah?
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could he be the Messiah?
Life in his hands, I understand he could be
Bread for our needs fully he feeds our hunger, older and younger
Twelve baskets more, can we ignore he shows us and he knows us
Is He the Christ?
God in his eyes, I realize his power, need of the hour
Jesus his name, they say he came to feed us and to receive us
Is He the Christ?
Could he be the Messiah?
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could he be the Messiah?
Life in his hands, I understand he could be the Messiah
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could he be the Messiah?
Life in his hands, I understand he could be
It is He the Messiah,
Miracle Man, part of the plan
It is He the Messiah
Life in hand, I understand
It is he the Messiah
Miracle man, part of the plan
It is he the Messiah, life in his hand
I know understand
It is he the Messiah,
He's the Messiah
It is He the Messiah
It is He the Messiah
It is He the Messiah...
